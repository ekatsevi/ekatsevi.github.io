Welcome to the statistics and genomics playground.
======

I love to think about the promises and challenges presented by modern high-throughput genomics, allowing us to efficiently make all sorts of measurements genome-wide. These kinds of data have enormous potential for science and medicine, and they present a variety of novel statistical challenges. The high dimensionality of the data makes it more challenging to select variables (e.g., genetic variants) that are important for a certain outcome (e.g., a disease). The high multiplicity necessitates careful multiple testing corrections to avoid excessive false positives. The structure of the underlying biology (e.g. spatial or graphical) imposes extra constraints. The exploratory flavor of genome-wide experiments must be accommodated without compromising the validity of the resulting scientific conclusions. These exciting questions have drawn me into statistical theory, methodology, and applications. 

**I am actively seeking graduate students, so if any of these topics pique your interest, please reach out to me!**
