About me
======

I'm an assistant professor at Wharton's [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/). My [research](https://katsevich-lab.github.io/) centers on several interconnected themes, spanning statistical theory, methodology, and applications. I work on modern 
**genomics** applications, which inspire me to consider methodological and theoretical problems in **high-dimensional variable selection, conditional independence testing, double/debiased machine learning, multiple testing, and selective inference.**

I teach [STAT 4710 (Modern Data Mining)](https://katsevich-teaching.github.io/stat-4710-fall-2023/) and [STAT 9610 (Statistical Methodology)](https://katsevich-teaching.github.io/stat-9610-fall-2023/) at UPenn.

In addition to teaching and research, I'm passionate about providing [resources and guidance](https://ekatsevi.github.io/resources/) for statistics students.
